          <h2>Packing Light</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              The first thing we had to do was learn how to pack. We each
              brought with us a backpack with just the essentials:
            </p>
            <ul id="packing_list">
              <li>A hammock</li>
              <li>A sleeping bag</li>
              <li>A headlamp</li>
              <li>Deodorant</li>
              <li>Toothbrush</li>
              <li>Toothpaste</li>
              <li>Rain Jacket</li>
              <li>Tarp and rope</li>
              <li>Water bottle</li>
              <li>Food</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are some supplies that were shared among the group: food,
              cooking supplies, first aid, etc. We carried everything in hiking
              backpacks. It ended up not being all that light after all the
              food...

          <h2>Feasting in the Forrest</h2>
          <p>
            When you're hiking for miles, every meal is delicious! We brought a
            portable cooking kit, and several supplies we were able to get
            creative with. We made pancakes, pizza, biscuits, rice and beans.
            That portable stove was handy! Of course we also had G.O.R.P. (Good
            Old Raisins &amp Peanuts) for the trail. For water, we had to use
            chemicals to purify water from streams. It tastes strange at first,
            but you get used to it!

          <h2>Sleeping Out</h2>
          <p>
            We all slept in hammocks under tarps. It was actually more
            comfortable than in the past when I have slept in a tent. Hammocks
            are more comfy than the ground. Each night we would hoist a bag with
            all our food up high in a tree to keep the smell of food from
            attracting bears to our campsite.

          <h2>"Getting to know you"</h2>
          <p>
            Of course our group had to develop a lot of trust with each other.
            None of each knew each other before the trip, but we sure did after!
            The group was led by student leaders from the college I went to. On
            the last day of the trip when we were all exhausted, the leaders
            surprised us with a special meal.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            I have very fond memories from this trip! I ended up going back for
            two more backpacking trips to the gorge the next two years. I hope
            to go again sometime.
